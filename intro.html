    <p>Googgle is an American multinational technology company focusing on search engine technology, 
        online advertising, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, 
        e-commerce, artificial intelligence,[9] and consumer electronics. It has been referred to 
        as "the most powerful company in the world"[10] and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its 
        market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence.
        Its parent company Alphabet is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, 
        alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.</p>
        <h2>Growth</h2>
        <body>
            In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[51] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[52] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[53][22] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[54] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[55][56]

In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[58] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[59] By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "google" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet". The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
